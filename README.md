# 3DwebsitePortfolio
This is still a work in progress. It will eventually become an interactive 3D Website Portfolio with animations (and a few cheeky surprises) in order to showcase myself and my skills. Basically, basically a project that bridges my software and hardware interests. STAY TUNED.

<!---
- whole page is inside a 3d model of my room
- as you scroll down it moves along the room, 
- introduction and explanations on the walls
- animations for real time sensor data and pictures of the real projects and links to github repos
- phone has github, instagram and linkedIn links
- watch clock displays the actual time of the user
- Laptop shows a directory with folders that have the names of all skills I have
- enable mussic from a small youtube popup on my laptop 3d model. ()


# Experience direction:
1. starts pointing directly to the bed, with an animation of me sleeping, window and shelf with books and plants (with plantSitter, with a ssd1306 display with a chart for the three plants) above the white heater
2. shelf with some projects (ledStrip Driver, WGExplorer, IoT Bike, Mathopoly ), when you hover over them, there's an explanation and github links
3. PC display with custom terminal, allows help/ and other commands,  connected to esp32VGA model, information and github link, 
4. laptop with screenshot of a directory with my skill as names for the folders
5. phone with icons for linkedIn, GitHub, Gamil, instagram, 
6. Shelf that opens and shows all physical things I have worked with (Arduino, ESP32, raspberry pi, STM32, )
7. 3d Black Guitar
